As I turn 40 this year, I've been reflecting on the journey of building Frontend Masters. Looking back at my [turning 30 post](/articles/30), I can see how four key skills from my twenties created the foundation for everything we've built in the last decade.

## The Foundation Years: Skills from My 20s

Building deep technical skills as a front-end developer from age 20-30 paid off tremendously. It helped me build a high-quality Frontend Masters platform that customers love for its performance and made communication with our technical audience much clearer. Going deep in your craft gives you a foundation to build everything else on.

Speaking at over 60 conferences &mdash; including running conferences of my own &mdash; created lasting relationships with the world's best instructors, many of whom still teach on Frontend Masters today.

Writing 200+ blog posts became my most valuable career skill - I still write all the copy for the Frontend Masters website, course announcements, and newsletters, reaching over 500,000 people multiple times each month. Understanding the importance of recurring revenue early on was crucial, giving me the stability needed to plan confidently around hiring and growing the business.

## The Building Years: Ages 30-35

The early thirties were challenging as I worked to transition from a solo operation to running a company while raising four kids. Despite the difficulties, by age 35, [I built the business into everything I dreamed of](/articles/turning-35). Credit due to the amazing team we've built over the years:

However, this success came at a cost to my personal health.

## The Health Adventure Years: Ages 35-40

At 35, while the business was thriving, my health had deteriorated - I even experienced bad back pain that would wake me up at night. I dedicated the next five years to improving my health, creating a [personal health checklist](/articles/personal-health-checklist) and gradually increasing my healthy habits and activities. The results speak for themselves: my VO2 Max improved from 37 to 45, and I've received numerous compliments on my physical appearance.

## 2024 Achievements

Physical Accomplishments:

- Back flipped on stage in front of 1000+ people
- Learned front flips
- Ran over 550 miles
- Improved VO2max from 41 to 45
- Added HIT training
- Established daily cold plunges

Personal Growth:

- Strengthened relationship with my wife
- Improved overall cognitive function
- Fixed issues with extended family
- Grew the business through strategic hiring

## Areas for Improvement

While this year brought many successes, some goals remained unfulfilled:

- Phone addiction resurfaced recently
- Flexibility improvements fell short of expectations
- Mixed progress in extended family relationships
- Limited weight training
- Swimming remained unlearned
- A broken thumb temporarily hindered handstand progress

## Lessons Learned: The Importance of Hard Conversations

Looking back, my biggest piece of advice to my younger self would be to face difficult problems sooner. I've learned that life is limited by the number of hard conversations you're willing to have. I used to avoid these conversations because I wanted to be liked, but I've come to understand that being decisive and direct isn't just about personal growth - it's essential for effective leadership.

Your team needs to know where they stand and where the company is headed. Clear communication, even when it's difficult, builds trust and momentum. While these conversations might be uncomfortable and sometimes result in tears or tough decisions, they're crucial for building an excellent business and creating a better life for yourself and your family.
