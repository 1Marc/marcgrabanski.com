As I turn 40 this year, I've been reflecting on the journey of building Frontend Masters. Looking back at my [turning 30 post](/articles/30), I can see how four key skills from my twenties created the foundation for everything we've built in the last decade. What started as a solo venture (with contractors) has grown into something far beyond what I initially imagined.

## The Foundation Years: Four Key Skills from My 20s (Two Decades Ago ðŸ˜…) that Built the Business in my 30s

1. Technical Mastery: Building deep technical skills as a front-end developer from age 20-30 paid off tremendously. It helped me build a high-quality Frontend Masters platform that customers love for its performance and made communication with our technical audience much clearer.

2. Community Building: Speaking at over 60 conferences â€” and running conferences of my own â€” created lasting relationships with the world's best instructors, many of whom still teach on Frontend Masters today.

3. Content Creation: Writing 200+ blog posts became my most valuable career skill. I still write all the copy for the Frontend Masters website, course announcements, and newsletters, reaching over 500,000 people multiple times each month. Writing is one of the most valuable skills you can have.

4. Business Acumen: Understanding the importance of recurring revenue and LTV (lifetime value) early on was crucial, giving me the stability needed to plan confidently around hiring and growing the business.

## The Building Years: Ages 30-35

The early thirties were challenging as I worked to transition from a solo operation to running a company while raising four kids. This period tested my leadership abilities, time management skills, and work-life balance. Despite the difficulties, by age 35, [I built the business into everything I dreamed of](/articles/turning-35).

Much love and credit is due to the amazing team we've built over the years!

However, this success came at a cost to my personal health. I was putting every ounce of energy into the business and not taking care of myself.

## The Health Adventure Years: Ages 35-40

At 35, while the business was thriving, my health had deteriorated - I even experienced bad back pain that would wake me up at night. I dedicated the next five years to improving my health, creating a [personal health checklist](/articles/personal-health-checklist) and gradually increasing my healthy habits and activities. The results speak for themselves: my VO2 Max improved from 37 to 45, and I've received lots of compliments on my physical appearance. I know my wife certainly likes it! ðŸ™ƒ

## Lessons Learned: The Importance of Hard Conversations

Looking back, my biggest piece of advice to my younger self would be to face difficult problems sooner. I've learned that life is limited by the number of hard conversations you're willing to have. I used to avoid these conversations because I wanted to be liked, but I've come to understand that being decisive and direct isn't just about personal growth - it's essential for effective leadership.

Your team needs to know where they stand and where the company is headed. Clear communication, even when it's difficult, builds trust and momentum. While these conversations might be uncomfortable and sometimes result in tears or tough decisions, they're crucial for building an excellent business and creating a better life for yourself and your family.

## Looking Forward

These lessons about facing challenges head-on and having difficult conversations have shaped not just my leadership style, but my approach to life. As I enter my forties, I'm excited to apply these insights to new challenges and opportunities. The journey of building Frontend Masters has taught me that personal growth and business success are deeply intertwined - each supporting and amplifying the other.
