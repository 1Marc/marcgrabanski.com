There are a lot of expectations on a modern adult.

you have to go to be active in your community, church, vote, clean your house, take care of your appearance, maintain a healthy relationship with everyone you are related to, stay out of debt, plan for retirement, have hobbies, maintain lifelong friendships, give good gifts, plan holidays and birthdays, maintain good relations with your neighbors, help friends and loved ones when asked, donate to charities, …and on and on to achieve what? Be everything everyone expects you to be. That’s the baseline.
