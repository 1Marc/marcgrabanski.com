### Welcome to My Career Journal. Occassionally I post things I've learned along the way!

My latest project is The Frontend Masters Podcast showcasing the stories of our instructors. You can find on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6El1Q4QV8OTAJVY2DWKMbo), [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-frontend-masters-podcast/id1710458565), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLum3CyP95edxwLIHenKw0nMHlfvr76ZSU).

In the past Iâ€™veâ€¦

- _created_ open source projects such as the [jQuery UI Datepicker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/) and most recently [Modern Vanilla JavaScript TodoMVC](https://github.com/1Marc/todomvc-vanillajs-2022)
- _podcasted_ both starting podcasts and [interviewed on them](/podcasts).
- _taught_ workshops (my favorite memory was teaching to 150+ people in Israel).
- _created_ conferences for 200+ people at Google HQ.
- _spoke_ at 60+ conferences on UI development topics (see past example [Whirlwind Tour of SVG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2K_pOp2ydQ).
- _blogged_ 200+ articles, mostly between 2007 and 2010.
