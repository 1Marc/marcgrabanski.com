The web is the most fertile ground to build on which is why I‚Äôve _dedicated my life_ to _teaching people_ how to build their dreams with _great user interface code and interface design_.

I am CEO of Frontend Masters¬†which publishes [in-depth, modern front-end engineering courses](https://frontendmasters.com).

Here is the (5 minute) story of starting the company:

_Customers_ have said some _amazing things about the service_ and so I know it‚Äôs making a big difference:

> ‚ÄúFrontend Masters videos have helped me _learn more about front-end in a couple of months than 10 years on the web_.‚Äù ‚Äì Leigh Mackay

> ‚ÄúThese are the _best tech videos I have ever seen_ in terms of production and content quality.‚Äù ‚Äì Steve King

In the past I‚Äôve‚Ä¶

- _created_ the open source project [jQuery UI Datepicker](http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/) (which is now one of the most popular UI component on the web).
- _blogged_ to 100k+ monthly unique visitors.
- _podcasted_ to 40k listeners.

## Timeline

I've written sporadic updates throughout the years, so here is a, "career cliff notes" if you will: ;-)

- 2017 - [The Year I Built a Team](/2017/)
- 2016 - Our 3rd child was born. A girl!
- 2014 - [I turned 30!](/30/) our¬†baby boy was born in Aug '14 (our first was born¬†in Dec '12). I quit consulting to work on Frontend Masters fulltime mid '14.
- [2013](/web-development-talks-2013/) - Did a decent amount of conference talks and launched [Frontend Masters video platform](https://frontendmasters.com) officially (March?ish). Got adjusted to having our first kid and life as a Father.
- 2012 - I ran the first Frontend Masters workshop series. Had our first baby girl!
- 2011 - Got married! Ran a 230+ person conference at Google HQ. I stopped blogging almost entirely but did manage to write a few personal posts on [concepts of wealth answering: 'are you rich?'](/are-you-rich/) (which I most certainly am not).
- [2010](/reflecting-career-and-looking-to-2011/) - I found out how important education is to me, did a lot of speaking and started creating conferences.
- [2009](/2009-in-retrospect/) - I did some international speaking and got engaged. I was working on building my consulting company further.
- [Summer 2009](/marc-grabanski-summer-2009/) - My startup Rent Update was launched. I retired my work on jQuery UI Datepicker. I learned a diverse set of web application frameworks and languages through working on client projects. I did lots of work with Ruby on Rails (previously I was working in CakePHP / straight PHP).
- [2008 Reflection](/acheiving-freedoms-in-2008/) - After much debate, I decided not to work as a contractor for Mozilla and instead got some local clients...I figured Mozilla can get whomever they want. It was a good decision as it turns out the local company I helped is now set to be on the Inc 500 list and has 30+ employees up from when I helped it was just two interns and an internet marketer with a mission. I was interviewed by Google and YouTube tons of times, but then realized I wanted to be independent which turned up clear through all the interviews. It was great to find out more of what I actually wanted.
- [2008 Leaving JWT Minneapolis](/rmg-connect-minneapolis/) - I quit my only full-time job ever in order to start a consulting company. I learned tons about business structure and employee roles at that full time job...worked on teams and met many amazing people. Many of the "recommendations I received were from that job.
- [2008 Goals for MarcGrabanski.com](/2008-plans-for-marcgrabanski-com/) - all of the important goals here I've accomplished like making my website reflect my personality and writing the articles I wanted to write.
- [Goals as of 2007](/career-goals-as-of-august-2007) - I set goals in 2007 and by now **I've accomplished all of them!** Even the 5-10 year ones. Amazing. Learning rapid web application development, speaking at conferences, creating a web conference in Minnesota, residual income and family/married/have kids. =)
- [2007](/2007-was-an-incredible-year/) - year of developing lots of open source (created jQuery UI Datepicker), got featured on Ajaxian which was big at the time and spoke at the first jQuery camp/conf.
- 2006 - Worked at a tiny web shop which was the [worst 6 months of my career](/lessons-learned-worst-job/). Started my first full time web development job which was an awesome job in August.
- 2005 - Graduated with a BA degree in CIS.
