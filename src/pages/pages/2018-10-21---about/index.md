In the past Iâ€™veâ€¦

- _created_ open source projects such as the [jQuery UI Datepicker](/jquery-ui-datepicker) (which was one of the most popular UI component on the web for over a decade).
- _podcasted_ both starting podcasts and [interviewed on them](/podcast-appearances).
- _taught_ workshops (my favorite memory was teaching to 150+ people in Israel).
- _created_ conferences for 200+ people at Google HQ.
- _spoke_ at 60+ conferences on UI development topics (see past example [Whirlwind Tour of SVG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2K_pOp2ydQ).
- _blogged_ 200+ articles, mostly between 2007 and 2010.
