[ShopTalk Show: Frontend Masterery With Marc Grabanski](https://shoptalkshow.com/408/) -- What Frontend Masters is, who it's for, how they decide what to teach, what's coming up, and the question everyone asks: what do I learn next?

Some podcasts appearances I've made in 2015:

[JavaScript Jabber: Tech Education and the Business of Frontend Masters](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/178-jsj-tech-education-and-the-business-of-running-front-end-masters-with-marc-grabanski) -- answering a lot of questions about e-learning and telling the history of Frontend Masters.

[Know Priorities: Marc Grabanski](http://talkabout.knowpriorities.com/3) - I spill lots of solid business tools and tactics. This is the deepest I've ever gotten into the business side.

[ShopTalk Show: Marc Grabanski](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/134-marc-grabanski/) - mostly about the Q&A. Discussing markdown, JSON and WordPress script loading.

[Online Course Coach: How to create video courses from LIVE online and in-person workshops with Marc Grabanski](http://www.truefocusmedia.com/how-to-create-video-courses-from-live-online-and-in-person-workshops-marc-grabanski/) - centered around the video production side and how to produce and promote online courses.
