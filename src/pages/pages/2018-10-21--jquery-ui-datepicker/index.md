Most likely, you are looking for a [demo of jQuery UI Datepicker](http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/).
The jQuery Datepicker project has been donated to the [jQuery UI project](http://jqueryui.com). However, since the jQuery UI team had a different direction in mind than Keith Wood (co-author of jQuery Datepicker), Keith Wood has created another implementation of, [jQuery Datepicker](http://keith-wood.name/datepick.html).

## Download jQuery UI Datepicker Standalone

Since the date picker was moved to the jQuery UI website, people have still asked how to download the date picker by itself.

1. _jQuery Library:_ Datepicker requires including [jQuery](http://jquery.com).
2. _JavaScript:_ [ui/core.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/core.js) and [ui/widgets/datepicker.js](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/widgets/datepicker.js)
3. _CSS Theme:_ Create your theme with [ThemeRoller](http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/)

## Bugs, Features and Support

Please submit any bugs and feature requests through the [jQuery UI trac](http://bugs.jqueryui.com/), I will no longer be accepting them via email.
I'm sorry for anyone who has asked for support on jQuery UI Datepicker and has not received a response in the past. Going forward, please submit support requests to the [jQuery UI forum](http://forum.jquery.com/using-jquery-ui). To help you along your way most of the issues can be solved by researching through the [jQuery UI Datepicker Function Documentation](http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#options)

## History of jQuery UI Datepicker

I wrote the date picker originally as a rewrite of [Clean Calendar](https://github.com/1Marc/javascript-clean-calendar) to try out the [jQuery JavaScript library](http://jquery.com).
The project gained traction in late 2006, when it was first released. [Keith Wood](http://keith-wood.name) decided to step on board to help the project, adding a whole slew of features. Meanwhile I have been getting emails from all around the world about my date picker (too many emails). We added feature after feature that was requested by our users - now the project has well over 35 customization options and counting. The datepicker is also in around 30 languages, showing its adoption worldwide.

During jQuery Camp 2007 in Boston, I gave a presentation of jQuery UI Datepicker.
The date picker is still being maintained by Keith Wood and I and continuing to be adopted by many websites in the world that use jQuery.
