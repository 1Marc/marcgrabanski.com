While visiting my parents I needed to get wireless internet working. After a half hour of investigation with the ISP tech support, they said, "it is your linksys router, call the manufacturer". Well, I know my router is just fine because I used it earlier that day at my house. So basically, what was happening is that if I hooked up the **cable modem to the main PC**, it worked. But if I tried to connect up the **cable modem to the router**, it wasn't working because the router was not getting an IP address from the ISP. I did some digging around in the control panel and found something new to me, "Clone Your PC's Mac" address:

This makes your router look like your PC to the ISP and **allowed me to connect just fine**. Try it sometime if you are having problems connecting your router to the internet.
