People often ask me, "What program are you using to do that?" So here is a list of all of the tools I have on my work computer.

#### Web Browsing
- [FireFox 2](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) - The extensions make FireFox a far superior browser to any other for web development and testing code.
- [Internet Explorer 7](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/default.mspx) - I use IE7 when FireFox doesn't work (usually Microsoft pages) or when I am developing with ASP.NET 2.0.

#### [FireFox Extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/extensions/)
- [ColorZilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/271/) - Pick the color of any pixel in FireFox.
- [IE Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1419/) - View how IE will render a page from within FireFox.
- [Download StatusBar](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/26/) - Inline downloads status instead of a pop-up.
- [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843/) - Inspect the DOM and debug Javascript (This is my favorite extension).
- [Foxmarks Bookmark Synchronizer](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/2410/) - Backup your bookmarks and synchronize them accross multiple computers.
- [Google Pagerank Status](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/262/) - Displays the pagerank of the page you are viewing on the statusbar.
- [SEO for FireFox](http://tools.seobook.com/firefox/seo-for-firefox.html) - Lookup various SEO-related information about any page.
- [Web Developer Toolbar](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/) - Tons of tools to help you debug your page.

#### Music
- [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) - Podcasts, internet radio, syncs with iPod, need I say more?
- [Last FM](http://www.last.fm/) - Dynamically creates a internet radio station based on the music you like.
- [Winamp Lite](http://www.winamp.com/player/free.php) - A compact music player that doesn't touch your system resources.

#### Web Development
- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm) - Highlights your code in a TON of different languages, tabbed interface, macros... all sorts of cool stuff that made me stop using notepad and switch to notepad++.
- [Dreamweaver](http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/) - Great file management that allows me to switch between projects quickly. Definitions of PHP functions built right into the editor.
- [Flash](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/flashpro/) - Interactive internet media development tool that is far superior to anything else I have seen.
- [Visual Web Developer Express](http://asp.net/downloads/default.aspx?tabid=62) - Free for commercial use and a great development environment for ASP.NET 2.0. Formats code when I am cleaning up sloppy unnested code (Control+K, Control+D).
- [Netbeans 5.5](http://www.netbeans.org/) - Java/JSP development environment that has built-in Tomcat server for fast local development.
- [MySQL Query Browser](http://www.mysql.com/products/tools/query-browser/) - View, edit and update MySQL databases.
- [Tortoise CVS](http://www.tortoisecvs.org/) - Repository for versioning files in the development processs.

#### Graphics

#### Other Useful Tools
- [JRuler](http://www.spadixbd.com/freetools/jruler.htm) - Measure the size of anything in pixels.
- [Filezilla](http://filezilla.sourceforge.net/) - Fast and lite FTP program.
- [Texter](http://lifehacker.com/software/texter/lifehacker-code-texter-windows-238306.php) - No more repetative typing! Setup hotkeys to stop typing the same thing over and over.
- [Multiple IEs](http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE) - Debug websites in old versions of IE.
- [GAIM](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/downloads.php) - Alternative to AOL Intant Messanger. It is basically AIM without the advertisments.
- [IE7 Inline Search](http://www.ieforge.com/InlineSearch/HomePage) - Module that adds inline search to IE7 instead of a pop-up.
