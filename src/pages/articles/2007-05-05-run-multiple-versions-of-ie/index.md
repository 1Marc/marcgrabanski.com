A friend sent me an standalone version of IE6 (Eolas version) today. I booted IE6 up on my machine with ease and my first question was, "Is this legal"? Well, I did some research and I was astonished by what I found!

Tredosoft's * "Install multiple versions of IE on your PC":http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE * - YES, thats right, you can install IE3 IE4.01 IE5 IE5.5 and IE6 on your computer! **Now you can see what grandma sees when she checks her email with IE 4.01!** I'm kidding - of course the main purpose of these older editions is for testing and fixing old IE bugs.

All of the versions of IE were installed on my computer in a minute. The only stipulation that I found was this: Microsoft supplemental EULA says : IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A VALID EULA FOR ANY "OS PRODUCT", YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO INSTALL, COPY, OR OTHERWISE USE THE OS COMPONENTS AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS UNDER THIS SUPPLEMENTAL EULA. p{margin:20px}(exe).

"Download Multiple IE Installer (EXE)":http://tredosoft.com/files/multi-ie/multiple-ie-setup.exe I am truly amazed.
