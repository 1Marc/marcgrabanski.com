[Objectifying JavaScript](http://www.digital-web.com/articles/objectifying_javascript/) is a must-read for Javascript developers. Jonathan Snook does a great job explaining how to use Object Oriented scripting by using the **object literal, **prototype, and \*\*returning an object in the constructor. You may also want to check out [Show love to the object literal](https://christianheilmann.com/2006/02/16/show-love-to-the-object-literal/) by Chris Heilmann as well. It didn't take long for me to grasp the object literal - which you can see by viewing my [clean calendar source](https://github.com/1Marc/javascript-clean-calendar). Enjoy the reads!
