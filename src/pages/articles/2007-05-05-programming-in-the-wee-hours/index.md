Do you ever have that itch at 2:30 AM to get up and program? Well this happened to me this morning and it is now 4:45 AM. My mind loves solving problems and doesn't care what time it is. This has happened since I was very young, age 14 on up. I would wake up early or never get to sleep because I was rolling around thinking of ways to solve computer and programming problems. Sometimes I feel like I was born for this.
