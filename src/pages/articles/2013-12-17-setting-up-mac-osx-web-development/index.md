Recently I had a machine break down and had to setup a new one and this is documentation of my setup. p=. !http://marcgrabanski.com/wp-content/uploads/mavericks2013-06-1913-30-56600-1372082910-500x312.jpg! In this article I give you all the apps I use, OS configurations and local hosting setup. h2. Mac OS X Apps I Install * [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) \- Quick shortcut to anything. * [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) \- For the codes. I switched to it from TextMate because it's super fast! * [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) \- To generate secure passwords is easy, only problem is it introduced a single point of fail. Either way, I can't live without the convenience of it. Has Safari and Chrome extensions as well as a menu bar icon in OSX for quick access. * [iTerm2](www.iterm2.com) \- Super terminal! * [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com/) \- Nice to clean up OSX icons when you get too many, or it you just want to hide certain icons you don't use ever. * Google Chrome of course. * [Dropbox](www.dropbox.com) \- Currently I have 500GB Dropbox and I only sync certain folders to my computer. This gives me an extra 300GB+ of storage. It's expensive, but I use it primarily to collaborate for work projects so it's a cost of doing business at this point. * [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/) \- It's a nice installer of the latest PHP and MySQL. I could configure this manually, but MAMP is so easy. \_As commentaries suggested, you can "Set Up Vagrant":http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/vagrant-quick-effortless-way-create-virtual-machines-local-web-development/ instead.\_ * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) \* [Sequel Pro](http://www.sequelpro.com/) \- Free tool to easily manage MySQL. MAMP starts by default at port 8889 with user:pass as root:root * Skype * [CloudApp](http://getcloudapp.com/) \- Nice way to drag and drop share files and especially images. Automatically copies the link to the file once it's uploaded to your clipboard. * Twitter - I find Twitter's default notifications to be annoying so I only setup menu highlighting when I'm mentioned. !http://marcgrabanski.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/twitter-settings-300x188.png! * [Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) \- For keeping your mac awake...especially during those long Dropbox syncs! * [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) \- Twitter natively supports saving links to Pocket and there's a Chrome extension, so if I don't want to lose a link I drop it in Pocket. * [Old Skitch](http://evernote.com/skitch/) \- I don't like the new Skitch...the old one was so simple! You can still download it by the link under the main download. !http://marcgrabanski.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/oldskitch-2-300x139.jpg! * [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) \- For FTP and S3 pushing/pulling files. Be careful with the "sync" feature though, I deleted some files from the server once (was not good). * GitHub for Mac - Find it's nice to keep a running track of all the projects I've cloned. * [ScreenFlow](http://telestream.net/screenflow/) \- Best screencasting app I've used -- I've tried most of the Mac ones I could find. * Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere) * Microsoft Office (Word and Excel) h2. OS-level Items Todo * Of course lots of updates in the app store including OSX itself. * Install XCode and the iOS Simulator (Preferences -> Downloads -> iOS Simulator) @/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/Applications@ Then drag app to dock for iOS testing * Setup Messages App for Google Talk and AIM * Move the OSX doc to the right. On a 13" the problem is more vertical space than it is horizontal. * In Settings -> Mission Control I uncheck "show dashboard as a space" because I want to see what I'm doing and have quick access to the calculator (fn + F12). h2. Bash Config [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/): \[code lang="bash"\] ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)" \[/code\] Add Sublime Text bin to terminal (run this in Terminal) \[code lang="bash"\] ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/sublime \[/code\] Install Paul Irish dotfiles and dependencies \[code lang="bash"\] git clone https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && ./sync.sh ./install-deps.sh sync.sh \[/code\] h2. Setting up Localhost Websites I edit my /etc/hosts file adding any local domains to it: 127.0.0.1 localhost mydomain.local myotherdomain.local Then I make a vhosts.conf file in @/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/vhosts.conf@ \[code lang="xml"\] NameVirtualHost *:80 ServerName mydomain.local DocumentRoot /Users/USERNAME/Sites/projects/mydomain/ Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews AllowOverride All Order allow,deny allow from all ServerName myotherdomain.local DocumentRoot /Users/USERNAME/Sites/projects/myotherdomain/ Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews AllowOverride All Order allow,deny allow from all \[/code\] Then finally adding @Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/vhosts.conf@ to the httpd.conf file and changing the DocumentRoot to my @/Users/USERNAME/Sites/@ folder. h3. Remove MAMP PHP Cacheing For some reason, MAMP defaults to having caching enabled which caused me issues. I had to disable it by going to \[code lang="bash"\] sublime /Applications/MAMP/conf/phpX.X.X/php.ini \[/code\] Then comment out @\[OPcach\]@. \[code\] ; \[OPcache\] ; zend\_extension="/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.5.3/lib/php/extensions/no-; debug-non-zts-20121212/opcache.so" ; opcache.memory\_consumption=128 ; opcache.interned\_strings\_buffer=8 ; opcache.max\_accelerated\_files=4000 ; opcache.revalidate\_freq=60 ; opcache.fast\_shutdown=1 ; opcache.enable_cli=1 \[/code\] h3. Migrate Host Data to Local I use [DB Migrate Pro](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/) to export a SQL file and import content to replicate the server to my local instance. Just unselect wp\_users and wp\_usersmeta if you just want the content. h2. Update Sublime Settings \[code lang="js"\] { "color\_scheme": "Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Sunburst.tmTheme", "font\_size": 16, "tab\_size": 2, "translate\_tabs\_to\_spaces": true } \[/code\] h2. Sharing Retina Screenshots Easily at Normal Resolution I managed to get "Gyazo Setup on My Own Server":http://benalman.com/news/2009/10/gyazo-on-your-own-server/ which allows you to upload normal resolution screenshots to your server just by opening Gyazo.app. I then used Automator to launch it by keystroke. Works perfectly. Hopefully you've found this setup guide useful. Let me know what apps and utilities I'm missing in the comments!
