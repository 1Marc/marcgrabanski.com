This combines much of the advice I give to friends and colleagues over the years (I advise many startups) all packaged together along with a bit of history of my career at the beginning of the talk.

This talk is **chock full of advice to freelancers / consultants and startups**.

_Quick note: It is my first public talk on business, so it takes a bit for me to get into the talk and find myself in it. Please forgive me for starting slow, but I do find my groove and give tons of advice and tips. I'm excited about this talk. Enjoy! :-D_

Some of the topics covered:

1. How to market yourself and why that matters
2. Benefits and pitfalls of consulting
3. Biggest mistakes creating startups (and how to avoid them)

I think it's one of my best unknown talks. It was given to a very small group of entrepreneurs -- no one but the ~10 people there have seen this talk before posting today! (I even debated releasing it because it contains many personal details).
