This is a simple issue, but on every project the debate always comes up about the proper usage of whether to use [Username" or "User name" for the login. According to dictionary.com, "username" is a word and it can also be used as [user name]. So **both cases are correct and it only matters that you use it the same way consistently across a website**. "Dictionary.com Definition of "username](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/username)[ An example of using "Username" for its login is, "Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) (there are many other examples of this). Again, this is simple but I've run into the debate enough times I decided to settle the case.
