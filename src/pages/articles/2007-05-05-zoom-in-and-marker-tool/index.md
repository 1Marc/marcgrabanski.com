"Zoom it!":http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/zoomit.mspx (Windows) is a very click way of zooming in. It also comes with a marker that you could use in a presentation or something. A simple hotkey (Control+1 by default) will take you into zoom mode which you can zoom in and out with the mouse scroll wheel. I feel like another level of control has been added to my computer with zoom it!
