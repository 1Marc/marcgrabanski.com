!http://marcgrabanski.com/img/eclipse-autocomplete.gif! I have been writing a "CakePHP":http://cakephp.org application and quickly realized I need something better for PHP development then Dreamweaver. I found "PDT (Eclipse with PHP Plugins)":http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/ and I am amazed at the helper tools they have for PHP developers. It has auto complete, tree view to browse functions and syntax highlighting. I probably haven't scratched the surface for its features. I was blown away with PDT I am going to use it from now on for PHP development. I had to do one setup for PDT to recognize CakePHP's thtml files: * Window->Preferences * General->Content Types->PHP Content Type * Add in *.ctp Thats it! I'm looking forward to better application development with Eclipse.
