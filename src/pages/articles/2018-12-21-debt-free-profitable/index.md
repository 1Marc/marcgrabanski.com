## Building a "Dream Team" Environment

**Most of what I've been thinking about these days is continuing to grow and build an amazing team.**

Some things the team needs:

- Be an active contributor to something bigger than themselves and connect to the mission.
- Be growing each day and around other people that are encouraging you to grow.
- Be in a financially secure environment.

That last one has been an issue in the early days... even into early this year. The team needs to feel secure and stable if they're going to view it as a viable career option and not just a temporary gig to add to their portfolio like many job options out there.

## Getting to Debt Free and Financially Stable

But Frontend Masters was incredibly expensive to get off the ground. On top of the normal labor costs that software companies have, we also had:

- Video equipment and production PCs
- A physical office space to record workshops
- Pay speaker and appearance fees
- Long production cycles so pay-off on investment isn't immediate

Plus with a subscription model it can take a long time and a lot of effort to gain enough subscribers to get over the hump.

### I'm Happy to Report We're Financially Stable, Debt-Free and Continuing to Grow

I've always carried a lot of debt since I started the business. But I the growth was always out-pacing the amount of expenses, so I figured at some point we'd cross the gap of profitability to be able to support our current efforts.

Forgive me for my terrible over-simplification of a sketch of 2012-early 2018, lol:

It was stressful carrying all this debt around, I'm not going to lie. ðŸ˜± Having a mountain of debt while getting married and starting a family is not a good feeling. Many companies get VC money for this reason.

...but on the other hand....**now we're debt-free, bootstrapped, and profitable. âœ¨ And no one can tell us what to do or not do while being financially independent.**
