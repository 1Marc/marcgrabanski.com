Through [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/), Mac users can run Windows programs. Regardless of what operating system you run, as a web developer you should never ignore Internet Explorer. There are still plenty of people using the browsers because it still runs natively in Windows. The best way I found to get IE6 and IE7 on my Mac was to use parallels and upgrade to Windows to IE7, then install [MultiIE](http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE) to get IE6 running. Take a look at this screenshot to see it in action:

It looks kind of strange to see a windows taskbar on a Mac, but hey - now I have both IE6 and IE7 running great on my Mac to fulfill my web development needs.
