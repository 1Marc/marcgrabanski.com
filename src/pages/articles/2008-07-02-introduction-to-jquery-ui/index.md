I published an article on learningjquery.com titled, ["Introduction to jQuery UI](http://www.learningjquery.com/2008/07/introduction-to-jquery-ui)" - I hope you enjoy the article! As a member of the jQuery UI team, I felt compelled to write this introduction because I didn't see any tutorials starting from the ground level. I'm hoping the article will help people get their feet wet with jQuery UI.
