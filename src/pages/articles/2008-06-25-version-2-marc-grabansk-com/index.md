> Note on June 27th: The website is now usable on IE6 and IE7.

Rebuilt from scratch on top of [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com), version 2 of MarcGrabanski.com has been launched! The first version was on top of PHP and HTML, which turned into a mess to maintain. This time I really thought long and hard on how to code the website from the ground-up. It is a pseudo CMS, blog and takes advantage of much of CakePHP's strengths.The code is 100% hand written in a text editor, as well as the design was done in illustrator. I purchased the computer/face, then heavily modified it and illustrated all of the items around the monitor and keyboard. I enjoy illustrating but don't get to do it very often (too much coding). Finally I feel like I have a website to be pleased about - despite the compliments on the old website by far and wide audiences, I was never too happy with it.But, this one *I enjoy and am pleased with* .Which is ultimately what matters.With this website I will be able to post more (hopefully) and definitely have a much easier time maintaining. *Enjoy the new website* , I know I will! P.S. Please report any bugs you find in the new site to "m@marcgrabanski.com":mailto:m@marcgrabanski.com
