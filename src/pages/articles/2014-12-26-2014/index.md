-This is the year I quit consulting.
- I put all my eggs into one basket in order to be building something lasting which increases its value over time. It was one of the most difficult years for me because for the first half of the year I was consulting while trying to bootstrap the business (two full time jobs). And not like other years where I was only consulting a little bit or working on the education business a little bit -- no...this year I was working full on both.
