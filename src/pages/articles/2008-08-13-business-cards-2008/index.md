After getting tired of not having business cards when people asked, I decided to buckle down and make some. I sent the design over to [www.overnightprints.com](http://www.overnightprints.com) to get them printed.They turned out _exactly_ how I wanted them - A+ print job by my standards. These cards turned out great!

It is exciting to have some business cards that are this nice. _No more writing my email address on a napkin!_
