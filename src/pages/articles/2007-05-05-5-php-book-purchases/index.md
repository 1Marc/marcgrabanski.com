I purchased 5 PHP books this morning. I am really excited to learn PHP security and check out the cookbook PHP examples. A friend suggested the SAMS book and Programming PHP, 2nd Edition was the #1 best selling book on bookpool. I will let you know what I think of them when I get a chance to dig through them. \* Essential PHP Security - $18.50 * PHP and MySQL Web Development, 3rd Edition - $31.95 * PHP Cookbook, 2nd Edition - $28.50 * PHP Solutions: Dynamic Web Design Made Easy - $21.95 * Programming PHP, 2nd Edition - $24.95 !http://marcgrabanski.com/img/book\_phpsecurity.gif! !http://marcgrabanski.com/img/book\_phpandmysqldev.gif! !http://marcgrabanski.com/img/book\_phpcookbook.gif! !http://marcgrabanski.com/img/book\_phpsolutions.gif! !http://marcgrabanski.com/img/book_programmingphpgif.gif!
