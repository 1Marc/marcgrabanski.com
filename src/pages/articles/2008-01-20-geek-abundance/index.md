h3{margin-top: 1em}. This is geek abundance. !http://marcgrabanski.com/img/energy-drinks.jpg! !http://marcgrabanski.com/img/adobe-cs3-master.jpg! Not only did I receive 30+ energy drinks, I just received "Adobe CS3 Master Collection":http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/mastercollection/ and "Adobe CS3 Web Premium":http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/web/?xNav=WP from inside Adobe for minimal cost. For anyone who doesn't know, that is 4,000+ dollars worth of software - Master Collection is Adobe's entire line of software. I never pirate software and don't agree with it. I believe you will be blessed for doing things legit and paying the people who work hard to make it.
