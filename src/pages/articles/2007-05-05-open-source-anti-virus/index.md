I uninstalled Norton because it told me that I needed to renew my subscription. Needless to say, I was annoyed that the **software I paid for was asking me for more money**. Plus Norton is a system resource hog and is incredibly slow. I researched for open source anti-virus software solution and decided on [ClamWin](http://www.clamwin.com/) (Windows). Overall I feel great about my decision. I am happy to rid my computer of the"Norton system resource hog" virus.
