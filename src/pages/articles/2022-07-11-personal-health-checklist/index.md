Consult your doctor on the best course of action for you. This checklist is for my reference primarily, but hopefully, sharing it can help you too.

Nothing here is revolutionary. It is a checklist to browse and remind yourself to make better and healthier habits. I use this daily/weekly/monthly to ensure I am incorporating all of these items regularly into living a healthy life.

## Eating Healthier

* Avoid processed foods (mainly processed meats) to reduce overall sodium intake and eat more nutritious foods.
* Walk or do some simple exercise after you eat.
* Limit alcohol or remove it altogether!
* Eat slower. Being in the present moment while eating can prevent overeating and help with better digestion.
* Drink more water. Usually, a good rule of thumb is at least 2L per day, but it could be more depending on your weight.
* Eat more fiber and vegetables and less meat. More lean meat and fish rather than red meat. The less sugar, the better.

* Eat less often in general. Incorporate some form of fasting.

## Supplements

* Get your blood tested to determine what nutritional supplements you should take. Universal supplements challenging to get enough of in modern society include, but are not limited to: Fish Oil, B12, Vitamin D, Magnesium, and Calcium.

* Sleep 7-9 hours per night; best to be at the same time every night. Some studies suggest that Melatonin ~2 hours before bed helps you get higher quality sleep.

## Exercise

* Aerobic capacity (V02 Max) is the strongest predictor of future health. Train VO2 max by maxing out your heart rate for four minute periods through sprinting, rowing, HIT, or other intense, short-term cardio activities. Strength training important to build and maintain muscle mass.

* Mobility is crucial. Stretch/do yoga daily in the morning and at night.

## Self Care

* Brush your teeth daily (3 times is best) and get your teeth professionally cleaned every six months. I was surprised to find that lousy mouth health is associated with an increased risk of heart disease.
* Take ice-cold showers and, even better yet, ice baths. Minimally has been shown to increase your mood and decrease inflammation.
* Regular sauna use is linked to significantly lower rates of cardiovascular issues and related deaths.
* Breathe through your nose primarily, especially at night.
* Interacting with animals has been shown to decrease levels of cortisol (a stress-related hormone) and lower blood pressure
* Jumping on trampolines is great for your joint and ligament health
* Learn to breathe and meditate
* People with a sense of humor live longer. And people who are optimistic live longer. Be optimistic and laugh more!
  > A meta-analysis from 6 prospective cohort studies (n=181,709) found that patients with a more optimistic mindset were at lower risk for all-cause mortality (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.82–0.92).
