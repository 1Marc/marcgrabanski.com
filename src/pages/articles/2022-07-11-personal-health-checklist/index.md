Of course, consult your doctor on the best course of action for you. This checklist is for my reference primarily, but hopefully, sharing it can help you too.

* Eat more fiber and vegetables and less meat. More lean meat and fish rather than red meat. The less sugar, the better.

* Avoid processed foods (mainly processed meats) to reduce overall sodium intake and eat more nutritious foods.
* Limit alcohol or remove it altogether.
* Exercise often with a mix of strength and cardio.
* Sleep 7-9 hours per night; best to be at the same time every night.
* Get your blood tested to determine what nutritional supplements you should take. Universal supplements challenging to get enough of in modern society include Fish Oil, B12, vitamin D, Magnesium, and Calcium.
* Stretch / do yoga daily in the morning and at night.
* Brush your teeth daily (3 times is best) and get your teeth professionally cleaned every six months. I was surprised to find Gum disease is associated with an increased risk of developing heart disease.
* Take ice-cold showers and, even better yet, ice baths. Minimally has been shown to increase your mood and decrease inflammation.
* Walk or do some simple exercise after you eat.
* Eat less often in general. Incorporate some form of fasting. (I do water fasts 24 hours weekly and ~72 hours quarterly.)
* Eat slower. Being in the present moment while eating can prevent overeating and help with better digestion.
* Drink more water. Usually, a good rule of thumb is at least 2L per day minimum, but it could be more depending on your weight.
* Regular sauna use is linked to significantly lower rates of cardiovascular issues and related deaths.
* Breathe through your nose primarily, especially at night.
* Interacting with animals has been shown to decrease levels of cortisol (a stress-related hormone) and lower blood pressure
* Jumping on trampolines is great for your joint and ligament health
* Learn to breathe and meditate
* People with a sense of humor live longer. And people who are optimistic live longer. Be optimistic and laugh more!
  > A meta-analysis from 6 prospective cohort studies (n=181,709) found that patients with a more optimistic mindset were at lower risk for all-cause mortality (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.82–0.92).
