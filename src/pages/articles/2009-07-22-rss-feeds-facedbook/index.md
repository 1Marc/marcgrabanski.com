If you hook your RSS feed up with Facebook, the items keep you inside the walled-garden of Facebook. Let me give you an example... so if I see this RSS item show up in the facebook stream: !http://marcgrabanski.com/img/facebook-rss-item.jpg! I click on the link and it sends me to a Facebook note. !http://marcgrabanski.com/img/facebook-note.jpg! The RSS feed links should go to the intended context, my blog and not stay inside Facebook as a note. !http://marcgrabanski.com/img/facebook-remove-rss-feed.jpg!
