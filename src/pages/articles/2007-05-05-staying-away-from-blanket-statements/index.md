p=. !http://marcgrabanski.com/img/public-speaking.jpg! Even as a web developer we need to be aware of how we communicate. You don't have to be politically correct all the time, but at least be aware of how you phrase things. \*Consider the following statements:\* bq. All ____ are ____. ____ blows away all other ____. These types of blanket statements are almost always offensive because they put something above everything else. \*Instead try the following:\* bq. This ____ suits me best. I'm very impressed with ____ ability to ____. This way you are putting your words into a positive statement that separates what you are talking about from others without bashing anything. Being respectful and caring enough to phrase your statements like this will help you in your personal life and career. Now, excuse me I'm off to follow my own advice!
