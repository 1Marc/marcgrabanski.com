p=. !http://marcgrabanski.com/img/coffee\_book\_session.jpg! I enjoy web development, but writing can be a necessary evil to get my ideas out to the public. We judge intellect by spelling and grammar, but this paragraph proves that spelling really doesn't matter. bq. Olny srmat poelpe can raed tihs. cdnuolt blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was rdanieg. The phaonmneal pweor of the hmuan mnid, aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn't mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae. The rset can be a taotl mses and you an sitll raed it wouthit a porbelm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. Amzanig huh? yaeh and I awlyas tghuhot slpeling was ipmorantt! The reason that I have this blog is because I am \*very fascinated about the web and what it offers to the world\*, not because I enjoy writing. So, if the people that read my blog enjoy what I have to say and not how I spell or my grammar I will be a happy camper.
