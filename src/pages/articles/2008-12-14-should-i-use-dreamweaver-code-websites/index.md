"Should I use Dreamweaver to code websites?" my short answer is, no - you should learn to use an editor that was made with coders as the main focus.

Yes, Dreamweaver contains a code editor. But my answer to why a coder should not use it goes back to the original intent of the application. **The intent of Dreamweaver was to give people who don't know how to code websites the power to build websites** . Today, Dreamweaver has changed quite a bit, giving coders some more tools to work with, but it hasn't lost it's original intent.
Adobe's focus with Dreamweaver is to create a website development tool that reaches the widest audience possible; which in-turn increases sales. Because of this goal, Dreamweaver has everything and the kitchen sink in it. Dreamweaver (in my opinion) suffers from feature bloat because it has such a wide target audience and the program is not 100% focused on the coder's needs.
Hats down to the Adobe Dreamweaver team for making a tool that reaches such a wide audience, but I will never use it because it doesn't have me (the coder) as the main focus. **My advise for coders is to find a tool that is solely focused on you, the developer and leave the design / hybrid software behind.**
