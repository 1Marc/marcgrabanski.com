![](http://marcgrabanski.com/img/logo-pivotal-tracker.jpg):http://www.pivotaltracker.com It is not very often that I am blown away by software to an (tech)emotional level. Today I was blown away. I honestly believe [Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com) could change the way I view product development from now on. I have even pitched this same type of idea to a business partners before: 
-ticket items based on value-added to the business
-. Finally, a tracking system that works like this. Here's 10 reasons I think Pivotal Track is amazing.

### 10 Reasons I am Blown Away By Pivotal Tracker # Creates charts of time line / deadline against amount of work yet to accomplish.

Look at how huge this is.. if your manager wants to hit the deadline, he/she has to remove "points", or feature requests and slide them to a new release. There is only so much you can get done in a given time period, and Pivotal Tracker makes that clear. # 
-Centered around value-added to the business
-. Amount of value added in a iteration (week) is the velocity. #
- Each new feature is assigned a point value depending on how difficult it is to implement. #
- Project's velocity is based on how many points you accomplish in an iteration (week).

#
- Chores and bugs are viewed as necessary overhead, but do not add value to the business so they do not contribute to a project's velocity. # *There is only so much you can get done in a week, realistically.* Pivotal Tracker knows this and pushes new items to the backlog, showing management a good idea of what is realistic.

# Team strength adjusts the amount of points able to accomplish in a given week.

Here the client was able to accomplish 9 points in a given week typically. Upon adding me, they adjusted team strength to 175%, allowing for 16 points worth of features to be shown in the weekly cycle. All features above 16 are scheduled for following weeks. # The server is polled periodically, allowing you to see changes your team makes without reloading the page. # Sortable, drag and drop prioritization of tickets. # Clicking, [start" shows that you are working on a particular bug, avoiding team overlap. # Make your project private *or public*. # Customizable view-panes and clone existing view panes. # Comment and attach files to tickets (stories). I've always wanted a tracking system that demonstrates the value that I am adding to the business when adding features. "Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com) does this for me. its feature set is just enough to add to your experience with the tool and not over-complicate things. Go use it now.
