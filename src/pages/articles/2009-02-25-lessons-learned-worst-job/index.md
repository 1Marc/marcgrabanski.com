In the last few years I have shared many triumphs and positive things, but now I am going to pull from a chapter in my life that was dark to pull out lessons learned and expose the story about this company I worked for. **Early-mid 2006 was _the worst 6 months of my professional life_**, but it didn't start that way.

## How It All Started

The owner was excited, seemingly honest and downright cheerful and optimistic to work with me. He landed his first website job building an e-commerce store and needed someone to develop it. Sure, I wasn't entirely equipped for the job but I took it on. He took the risk for a very tiny sum of money and we worked on it together day and night for about 400 hours to get it done. During this time, **he yelled and swore at me for losing a few hours of data entry.** I should have heeded that warning and not continued working with him, knowing that it would happen again in the future. But none-the-less, I liked the work I was doing so I continued onward.

## How I Got Stuck in the Job

I really liked the guy, trusted him and we continued to take on more website jobs. _I definitely saw an anger issue in him through this time, but hey - who doesn't have problems?_ I enjoyed the work, but **figured I could not get another job doing website design in the area because it is a small area and I didn't have any kind of name for myself.** I continued to work and try to get better at my job. Meanwhile, I was not making enough to pay rent and going into debt ($10/hour job, even though I had finished 4-years of schooling at $28k/year).

## The Tyrannical Man Shows his Colors

I was happy with the location, but became more and more unhappy with my job as the outbursts of anger and rage moved from me, to the **other workers (also hired for dirt cheap) who were yelled at (including profanities) until forced to quit.** _One of the workers shared with me how he became so depressed that it spread to the relationship with his wife_. He finally got a job elsewhere, took it and got the heck out of there. I didn't blame him, but for the time I was stuck for the aforementioned reasons.

## Learning to Listen to Grievances and Anger

After my co-workers quit from the job because of the owner's raging outbursts, I was the only one left. Why was I still there? Because I thought that by _staying there it would making me stronger_. It did. **By hearing a list of grievances against me each day for a few months, I learned to tell truth from a lie and not get upset. This was a great skill to learn.** It isn't that I wasn't listening to him, it was just that I didn't agree with what he was doing to me or how he ran his business. Even so, _I sincerely checked myself to see if I really was a screw up, because his shredding comments got through to the deep parts of me._ This guy once wrote out an 8 page summary of grievances against me, at one point even mentioning that I was"poisoning the well". "Crazy", I thought. "I couldn't be such a horrible person as this man describes me to be". After a few months of realizing that I was truly well-intended (hard to do when words are so harsh) and knowing full-well that I was trying hard as I could (given the circumstances) - I knew it was time to leave.

## How I Got Out

I put my resume on Monster.com and _within a week_ was hired at in agency in Minneapolis, MN. The new job was a great move, a [wonderfully refreshing experience](/rmg-connect-minneapolis) filled with positive reinforcements and triumphs. Really, you can't get much more of a [high", after such a low. People always wondered why I was so happy and working so hard. I have [testimonials to prove it](http://www.linkedin.com/in/1marc).

## Positive Outcome

In the Midst of Working for a Nagging and Angry Boss Through the hard times you have the potential to grow in the midst of it, and this experience was no exception. For all those caught in a destructive working relationship with your employer I just want to give a few words of advice:

- **Try to honestly seek out if the bad things they are saying about you are true.**
- **Sort out truth from a lie, and use it as leverage to be a better person.** No one will be more honest about your weaknesses than someone who is violently angry at you, even though any grievances will be amplified beyond truth.
- **Keep your head up, learn to deal with it and then get a new job. It will be a great one.**

## Final Note

Regardless of how difficult this was for me to write about such a deeply negative experience. It is hopefully worth it for you, my readers to learn from and certainly my personal health to finally get this out there. _Keep it real, yall._
