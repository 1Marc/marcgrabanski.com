> Update Here's an updated article with the [tools I use on Mac OS X](http://marcgrabanski.com/setting-up-mac-osx-web-development/).

First, I want to preface this article by saying that this is not just another big list of every web development tool on the internet. **This is a list of tools that I rely on for my job as a web developer and I use these tools every day!**

This arsenal of web development tools was gathered from my computer at work (Windows XP) and is a little more current than my previous post on "tools to get the job done":http://marcgrabanski.com/article/30/Tools-For-Getting-the-Job-Done .

### Coding Tools
- "E Text Editor":http://www.e-texteditor.com/ - My favorite text editor. Basically a textmate clone with a few added features. I use this for quick edits, HTML documents and helpful code macros. $30
- "Aptana":http://www.aptana.com/ - This is my PHP/HTML/JS/CSS project editor for larger projects. In order to edit PHP, you have to install the PHP plugin. The standalone version is faster than the eclipse plugin version.
- "Eclipse (Java EE)":http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ - For editing Java and JSP projects.
- "Winmerge":http://winmerge.org/ - Use in conjunction with CVS and SVN to merge and compare files.
- "MySQL Browser":http://www.mysql.com/products/tools/query-browser/ - Editor for MySQL tables.
- "WAMP":http://www.wampserver.com/en/ - Creates a local server with Apache, MySQL and PHP. Some nice features for quickly editing server settings.

### Utilities
- "7zip":http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/ - Archive extraction (ZIP, RAR, ...).
- "Filezilla":http://filezilla-project.org/ - FTP tool.
- "putty":http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/ - SSH tool.
- "Texter":http://lifehacker.com/software/texter/lifehacker-code-texter-windows-238306.php - Set up macros to avoid typing the same things over and over.
- "Taskbar Shuffle":http://www.freewebs.com/nerdcave/taskbarshuffle.htm - Allow re-organizing your active taskbar items.

### Communication
- "Pidgin":http://www.pidgin.im/ - All-in-one instant messaging. I use it for Google talk, MSN, AIM and Yahoo.
- "Hydra IRC":http://www.hydrairc.com/ - For chatting with other programmers. I hang out in irc.freenode.net, mostly in the room #cakephp.

### Music
- "Last.fm":http://www.last.fm/ - Auto creates radio station and has improved drastically. I used to hate the songs that it plays based on my music taste, but now I love them. This is a must have for music lovers.
- "Winamp":http://www.winamp.com/ - I use the light version for quickly listening to audio files. It is just so quick, compared to iTunes which is a bloated monster.

### Web Utilities
- "jRuler":http://www.spadixbd.com/freetools/jruler.htm - Quick measuring tool, I use this constantly to line up my HTML/CSS layouts perfectly with the design documents.
- "Multi IE (IE6&IE7)":http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE - To master the ways of IE6 you must have this nowadays.

### Firefox Addons
- "Firebug":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843 - This is the #1 most useful tool for web development. You can inspect element properties, log JavaScript messages, pretty much the everything and the kitchen sink for web development.
- "Firecookie":http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/?page_id=5 - Use this firebug extension to add cookie debugging, I always wondered why firebug didn't have this by default.
- "Delicious Bookmarks":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3615 - Instead of putting all my bookmarks in folders, I now use delicious bookmarks toolbar. I can search my bookmarks, tag bookmarks, etc all from a sidebar of my browser.
- "Colorzilla":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/271 - Picking colors is so necessary, and Colorzilla makes it easy to copy colors from web pages into my design programs. My friend, Royal, told me about "Pixie":http://www.nattyware.com/pixie.html because it is browser independent, maybe I will switch to this eventually.
- "Web Developer Toolbar":https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/60 - I use this as a shortcut to disable JavaScript, since firebug has replaced a lot of its uses this isn't as useful to me.

### Design
- Fireworks - I recently ditched Photoshop as my main web design tool, because for layouts it is so much faster. The combination of Vector + Bitmap is a nice hybrid tool to get the job done.
- Photoshop - It took me 4+ years to feel like I know this program, but once you learn it you can't live without it for photo and high-quality bitmap editing.
- Flash - Even with JavaScript doing so much animation these days, you just can't beat flash for rendering nice animations on the web.

I hope you've found something useful in this arsenal of web development tools. It is amazing that I need so many tools, but everything has its place. Most of these tools are free, and now looking at them in retrospect I should probably go through and donate to each tool's author. They have made a serious impact on my ability to get things done.
