I spoke at: [Fluent Conf Online](http://oreillynet.com/pub/e/2969), [JS Day Italy](http://2013.jsday.it), [Minnesota Developer's Conference](http://mdc.ilmservice.com/), Clockwork JavaScript, MinneBar, [MN Web Design](http://www.meetup.com/mn-web-design/events/95185932/) and [JavaScript MN](http://www.meetup.com/JavaScriptMN/events/128471632/).
