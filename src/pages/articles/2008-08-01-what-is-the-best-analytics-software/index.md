> Update August 1: This is a broad question - and broad questions deserve broad answers. If I need in-depth information about a specific analytics need, I will follow up with another question and reward.

I've used "Mint":http://haveamint.com, "BLVD":http://www.blvdstatus.com and "Google Analytics":http://www.google.com/analytics/ - but I still want to know what the best software is for gathering data. Please explain *why* the software is the **best** in as little as a few sentences, and as much as a few paragraphs.I don't mind long answers if you want to take the time, but this is meant for myself and others to get a general flavor of what people think regarding analytics packages. p(reward). I tried to give $5 to Bernd for his "thought-provoking answer":http://marcgrabanski.com/answers/what-is-the-best-analytics-software#c554, but he denied it. Thanks for all your answers, the answers are now public.
