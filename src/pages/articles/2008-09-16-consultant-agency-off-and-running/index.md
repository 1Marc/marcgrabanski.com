!http://marcgrabanski.com/img/consultants.jpg! I have been operating as a small consulting agency for my clients lately. Here is what has been happening: # Client seeks out my work. # We begin a working relationship. # Client needs more work done, so I find another worker. # I remain point of contact, but bill client for worker's time and my time to get more done. This is pretty simple, but works out well. The client only needs to go through one channel of communication does not have to worry about the work getting done, because I can hire up for what the client needs. The truth is, most clients are not able to find the right people to work with. Since I have worked both in corporations and also in open source, I know a strong network of people. This also saves the client overhead of finding the right people for the job. They can rely on the work that I will deliver. This has been a great shift of focus and I am privileged to be providing people jobs through my clients while being able to deliver more work than before.
